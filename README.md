# InsightForge
InsightForge is an AI-ready Data Science Research Assistant that profiles datasets, detects data quality issues, applies rule-based data science reasoning, and generates expert-level analytical prompts and reports. It mimics how a senior data scientist thinks—bridging raw data to actionable ML strategy using modular Python architecture

# InsightForge – AI-Powered Data Science Research Assistant

InsightForge is a modular Python system that behaves like a junior-to-senior data scientist in code.

Given a dataset, it:
- Profiles the data (shape, types, missing values, target, imbalance)
- Applies rule-based data science reasoning
- Suggests preprocessing strategies and ML approaches
- Generates an expert-level analytical prompt/report
- Is fully AI-ready (LLM layer can be plugged in later)

This project demonstrates how real-world AI systems are engineered:
Data → Profiling → Reasoning → Prompt Engineering → Report Generation

It is designed for:
- Data analysts & ML learners
- Auto-ML style experimentation
